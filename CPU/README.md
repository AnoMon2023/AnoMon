# Codes on CPU Platform

This folder conatains the C++ codes evaluating OctopusSketch and CellSketch on CPU platform. We evaulate the performance of OctopusSketch on finding AFG with drastic packet drops and inflated latency, and evluate the performance of CellSketch on estimating per-flow packet interval distribution. 

## File Descriptions

- `OctopusSketch_Experiments` contains the codes to evaluate the performance of OctopusSketch.
- `CellSketch_Experiments` contains the codes to evaluate the performance of CellSketch.

More details can be found in the folders.
